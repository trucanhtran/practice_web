            <h3> Religion</h3>

            There is no official religion in Vietnam, but Buddhism is relatively popular. Some of the Catholic churches
            and Buddhist pagodas are interesting tourist attractions. There are religions more specific to the southern
            regions of the country such as the Caodai sect, the Hoa Hao sect, and Islam. Most Vietnamese worship their
            ancestors.

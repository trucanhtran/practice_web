      There is no official religion in Vietnam, but Buddhism is relatively
      popular. Some of the Catholic churches and Buddhist pagodas are
      interesting tourist attractions. There are religions more specific to the
      southern regions of the country such as the Caodai sect, the Hoa Hao sect,
      and Islam. Most Vietnamese worship their ancestors.
